### What is World Anvil
WorldAnvil (WA) is a website allowing storytellers, players, gamemasters, writers, and worldbuilders to create stories and a universe. It provide a canvas to write and link your stories to your world.

#### My WorldAnvil
This project started in order to create and share the detail of a fantasy world of my own: Toriel. Toriel is a world set in a medieval fantasy setting in which the magic is always present, and where dragons may roam the sky.

*The dragons are an ancient race of powerful reptilian creatures. Born into this world during its creation, te Dragon are said to have shaped the world for the other races to inhabit. Each dragon type to emerge represented one element, ranging from metals and gems to fire and frost.*

*The Giants came next, shaping the land in finer detail, often chagning what the dragons had formed. This is thought to be the source of the fierce animosity between the two races.*
